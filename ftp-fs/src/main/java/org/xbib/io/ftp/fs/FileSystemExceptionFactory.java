/**
 * A factory for creating {@link FileSystemException}s based on replies from an FTP server.
 * It's not always possible to distinguish different types of errors. For instance, a 550 error code (file unavailable) could indicate that a file
 * does not exist (which should trigger a {@link NoSuchFileException}), or that a file is inaccessible (which should trigger a
 * {@link AccessDeniedException}), or possibly another reason.
 * This interface allows users to provide their own mapping, based on both the reply code and the reply string from an FTP reply.
 * Ideally implementations return exceptions that implement {@link FTPResponse}.
 * This way, the original FTP reply code and message will be reserved.
